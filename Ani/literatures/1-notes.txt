user interest = reward

constraints: path length, start 's', end 't'

obj func: cumulated reward, not the same as the wanted one

Si is point or set? what does the |.| means? Answer: points, number of points

r disappeared for r << distance between points

design of the scores: by fairness, by dominence, by distance

the choice of f is pretty dominating ~= 3 different strategy

questions: optimality? evaluated using user feedback

straight forward algorithm, interesting experiment

what more can we do? multi-user single agent to multi-user multi agents: need to figure out the deligation of tasks
