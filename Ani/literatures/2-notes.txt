title: Reinforcement learning for the traveling salesman problem with
refueling

problem: Traveling salesman problem with refueling

approach: Q-learning, SARSA

Results: it works, a lot of params tuning

inspiration: RL works, search space is huge due to np hard, but not unreasonable, but the definition of the states and actions need to be designed
