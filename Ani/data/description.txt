5 is low uncertainty/ high certainty

Attchedness is whether or not the rock at surface is attached to the bedrock (if this is low then geologists will not trust any spatial measurement).

Lithology is what type of rock is observed.

Geometry is spatial data such as the 3-D orientation of a feature in the rock (e strike and dip data of bedding orientation). 

Both Lithology and geometry would be used by geologists to estimate rock properties in areas where there is no data, but on a map lithology would be shown as a colored region without specifying where the observations were made to fill in the rock type and geometry would be shown as point data (strike and dip) or as a line where a feature intersected the surface.
