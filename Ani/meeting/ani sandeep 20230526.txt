work routines: slack, meeting each week?

what I did: poke around tsp, found TOP, very close to what we want, lots of combinatory opt and mixed int opt, but very promising to work

a possible approach: RL, the search space is huge, the definition of states and actions seems non trivial

help paul on the meam620 codes

data processing: the def of the uncertainty(determine what the reward structure looks like), permutation of the missing data(based on some sort of KNN like the netflix rec system)

plan: deal with the data processing, read the 2 survey on TOP, implement some classic TOP alg, string them all together, then decide what is next

plan to do a scatch on how it works and how it maps into the paper of multiple objectives, the missing data is not a thing to consider for the moment

OP goes first

simulate another dataset simple enough to validate

identify background to learn about: ant colony optimization, OP

plan with sandeep next week, Wed the week after
